# MyReads Project

MyReads is a simple bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Setup

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work on the search page of the app.
